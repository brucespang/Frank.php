Framr is a clone of Sinatra in php. It's much like the default version of Sinatra, with a few things missing (because php is stupid, or because I haven't gotten around to it yet).

What Framr is missing:
1. Spiffy template languages like haml and sass.
2. Middleware.
3. Error handling besides not_found(function(){});
4. Helpers
5. Environments
6. Halting
7. Passing
8. Testing
9. Regex routes, or using "*" in routes. Just use :whatever, and you'll be all set.

Here is Sinatra's hello world:
require 'sinatra'

get "/" do
	"Hello, World"
end

And here is Framr's hello world:
require('framr.php');

get("/", function(){
	echo "Hello, World";
});

As you can see, they're fairly similar.
